[notes]
- scipy appears via sklearn or advanced model features; explicitly list under optional/full to avoid heavier install for minimal crawl+heuristic runs.
- joblib is often installed with scikit-learn; added explicitly for clarity.
- If minimal footprint desired: pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml tqdm numpy scikit-learn
- For full feature set (zero-shot + embeddings): pip install -e .[full]
- Development extras could be added to pyproject optional-dependencies as: dev = ["pytest", "black"] (already present).
